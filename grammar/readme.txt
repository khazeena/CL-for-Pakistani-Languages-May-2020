In these sessions, we will learn Urdu grammar by making (universal) dependency structures of around 50 Urdu sentences. This exercise will help us to understand Urdu grammar. It will give us an idea of computational grammar of other Pakistani languages too.
The sessions will involve practical work i.e. 5-10 sentences will be sent to the participants 3 days before the session, so the participants try to create the dependency structures before the session, and then the structures and associated concepts will be discussed in the session.
The first session will give a brief introduction of phrase structures, lexical functional grammar and dependency structures. From the second session, we will focus on universal dependency structures of Urdu.

The website of Universal Dependencies are here:
https://universaldependencies.org/

These sessions will be helpful for the persons who want to
(a) understand Urdu grammar 
(b) create dataset for syntactic analysis 
(c) use dependency structures in their computer applications.

The series is in continuation of "Computational Linguistics for Pakistani Languages" by Tafseer Ahmed
